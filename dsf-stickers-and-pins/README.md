# DSF stickers and pins

![Seven sicker variations, repeated over two rows, with white and black background](./all-pins-preview.png)

The dark green variant is [Django’s official logo](https://www.djangoproject.com/community/logos/) `#092E20` color. All other variants come from color variations initially [picked for Wagtail](https://github.com/wagtail/brand/tree/main/stickers). The specific hues are meant to be aesthetically pleasing and distinguishable from each other, they don’t have any special significance.

Like the official logo, the type face is [DTL Prokyon](https://www.dutchtypelibrary.nl/Prokyon_rdrct.html) (`DTL Prokyon T`).
